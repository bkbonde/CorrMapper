            CorrMapper is an online research tool for the integration and visualisation of complex biomedical
            and omics datasets.
            <br><br>
            It allows users to:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    map clinical metadata onto the omics datasets using an automatically generated dashboard interface,
                </li>
                <li>
                    perform feature selection on the omics datasets using one of the clinical metadata variables,
                </li>
                <li>
                    infer robust correlations between the selected features of one or two omics datasets,
                </li>
                <li>
                    visualise and analyse the networks of these correlations using highly interactive modules.
                </li>
            </ul>

            CorrMapper is a data exploration and hypothesis generation tool.
            It does not try to automate statistical inference, or provide predicitve models.
            It is simply making the simultaneous exploration of omics datasets and clinical metadata easier by reducing the number
            of predictors to the clinically relevant ones, and by providing novel and interactive visualisation modules.

            <br><br>
            Very importantly, if you would like to use the features that were selected by CorrMapper for modelling,
            you must ensure that the model is built and validated on new data, that was not included in the feature selection.
            Otherwise the generalisation error of your model will be underestimated. See Chapter 7.10.2 <i>The Wrong and
            Right Way to Do Cross-validation</i> in <a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print10.pdf">
